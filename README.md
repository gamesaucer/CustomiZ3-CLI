# CustomiZ3-CLI

## Description

[CustomiZ3](https://github.com/gamesaucer/CustomiZ3-Core) is a tool for customizing Zelda 3 roms. It relies fully on the contents of the provided rom, as most of its editing capability consists of pointing to other parts of the rom and copying over values.

The tool has an internal map of where to find certain game data, and by providing instructions, it becomes possible swap or copy the behaviour of things such as holes, bird locations and whirlpools to other objects of the same type.

CustomiZ3-CLI is a commandline implementation of CustomiZ3, so that it can be used without any programming being required.
